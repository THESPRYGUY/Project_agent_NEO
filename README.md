# Project Agent NEO â€” Quickstart & Onboarding

Status: Release 2.1.2-dev (post v2.1.1)

Project Agent NEO is a governed, test-driven scaffold for generating and validating a 20-pack agent repository from a v3 intake. It emphasizes strict KPI parity, observability, and safe reasoning footprints while remaining model/vendor agnostic.

## 1) What is Project Agent NEO
One-paragraph: NEO provides a reproducible intake â†’ build â†’ validate pipeline producing a canonical 20-file agent repo. It ships a simple WSGI service, UI helpers, builders/validators, and CI gates (parity, golden snapshot, smoke) to ensure deterministic, auditable outputs for any use-case.

## 2) TL;DR Quickstart (5 minutes)
Copy env and run local compose, then hit health:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
# In another shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
```

You should see HTTP 200 with headers `X-NEO-Intake-Version` and `X-Commit-SHA`.

## 3) Dev Setup (10 minutes)
- Python 3.11 and Node 20.x
- Install and run tests:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest -q -vv

npm ci
npm test
```

## 4) CI Matrix (Required + Advisory)
Required checks (enforced in PRs):
- unit-python (coverage)
- unit-js (Vitest thresholds)
- golden snapshot
- docker-build-smoke
- smoke (strict parity ON)
- contract-validate (contract+parity crossrefs)

Advisory/non-blocking:
- Integration tests (-m integ)
- Docs check (SCA warn-only and optional markdown lint)

## 5) Parity, Contracts & Golden Snapshot
- Parity model: KPI targets from intake must match across 02 vs 14; propagated to 03/11/17. CI treats mismatches as blocking.
- Golden snapshot: builds from ixtures/intake_v3_golden.json and verifies byte-for-byte equality with ixtures/expected_pack_golden/*. Diff artifacts uploaded under _artifacts/golden-diff/** on failure.

## 6) Release Flow
Tags `v*` trigger the release workflow:
- Build container, smoke `/health`, generate integrity artifacts
- Attach to release: `repo.zip`, `INTEGRITY_REPORT.json`, `build.json`

## 7) Security Posture

See `SECURITY.md` for the full policy and reporting process.

Supported Versions

| Component | Version |
| - | - |
| Python | 3.11 |
| Node.js | 20.x |
- Dependency pinning: Python constraints and Node lockfile; SCA runs warn-only in CI and uploads reports
- Optional auth stub (default OFF): when `AUTH_REQUIRED=true`, all non-`/health` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; 401 JSON envelope returned on missing/invalid tokens
- â€œNo secrets/PII in logsâ€ policy

## 8) Troubleshooting
- Line endings: normalize to `\n` in snapshots to avoid diffs
- Env flags: set `FAIL_ON_PARITY=true` to enforce hard parity gates locally; `NEO_APPLY_OVERLAYS=false` for baseline runs
- Docker bind issues on Windows: prefer WSL2 backend; ensure `.env` exists

## Features

- **Deterministic configuration** â€“ dataclass based models with JSON helpers keep
  runtime settings predictable.
- **Conversation aware state** â€“ a structured conversation history is maintained for
  every dispatch, enabling downstream analysis.
- **Modular skills** â€“ skills are simple callables that can be dynamically discovered
  from configuration entrypoints.
- **Planning pipeline** â€“ the runtime produces a basic plan and executes each step
  through a configurable pipeline.
- **Observability** â€“ event emission and telemetry utilities capture metrics during
  execution.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
neo-agent --config path/to/config.json
```

If no configuration path is supplied, the default configuration containing the `echo`
skill will be used. Dispatches can be driven programmatically via the
`neo_agent.AgentRuntime` class:

```python
from neo_agent import AgentConfiguration, AgentRuntime

runtime = AgentRuntime(AgentConfiguration.default())
runtime.initialize()
result = runtime.dispatch({"input": "Ping"})
print(result["echo"])  # -> "Ping"
```

### Custom agent intake page

Launch the customizable intake experience using the bundled WSGI server to produce
tailored agent profiles and spec files:

```bash
python -m neo_agent.intake_app
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to select the agent domain, role, toolsets, attributes,
and behavioral sliders. The form also accepts a LinkedIn profile URL; available
metadata is scraped and merged with the manual selections. Submitting the form
creates `agent_profile.json` and, after Build, writes the single source of truth (SoT)
pack under `_generated/<AGENT_ID>/<UTC_TS>/`. Spec previews are written alongside the
SoT under `<outdir>/spec_preview/`. Deprecation: references to `generated_specs/` are
deprecated for one release. A 307 shim redirects legacy requests to the latest
`<outdir>/spec_preview/`.
derived configuration and metadata artifacts used by the generator.

#### Intake Section Order & Gating
- Order: Agent Profile â†’ Business Context (NAICS + Domain) â†’ Business Function & Role â†’ Persona Alignment â†’ Toolsets â†’ Attributes â†’ Preferences â†’ LinkedIn â†’ Custom Notes
- Generate Agent Repo is enabled only when: agent_name, NAICS, business_function, and role are all set.
- Persona Suggest is enabled after choosing a role.

## Testing

The repository relies on `pytest` for test execution:

```bash
pytest
```

Node UI utils use `vitest` for lightweight tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Testing & CI

- Pytest markers: `unit` (default), `integ`, `smoke`.
- Default `pytest` runs only unit tests; use `pytest -m integ` for integration.
- Python coverage enforced via `.coveragerc` (fail_under=85). CI runs `coverage run -m pytest` then `coverage report`.
- Vitest covers `tests/unit_js/**` with thresholds: lines 80, functions 80, statements 80, branches 70 (see `vitest.config.ts`).
- CI gates: unit-python and unit-js are required; integration is advisory; smoke runs via `python ci/smoke.py` and must pass.

## Smoke Test

Run the end-to-end smoke locally (builds a canonical 20-pack repo, emits artifacts):

```bash
make smoke
```

Artifacts are written to `_artifacts/smoke/`:
- `repo.zip` â€” zipped generated repo
- `INTEGRITY_REPORT.json` â€” integrity + parity summary
- `build.json` â€” CI-parsed summary with `file_count`, `parity`, `integrity_errors`

The command prints a one-line status, for example:

```
✅ SMOKE OK | files=20 | parity=ALL_TRUE | integrity_errors=0
```

### Strict Parity in CI

- Gate: CI enforces KPI parity as a hard gate with `FAIL_ON_PARITY=true` across all jobs.
- Artifacts: job uploads `_artifacts/**`, `**/INTEGRITY_REPORT.json`, `**/build.json`, and any `**/*.zip` on every run (pass/fail).
- PR Summary: CI posts a one-line outcome. Green shows:
  - `âœ… ✅ SMOKE OK | files=20 | parity=ALL_TRUE | integrity_errors=0`
  Red shows:
  - `âŒ Parity failure â€” see integrity artifacts`
- Triage: open uploaded `INTEGRITY_REPORT.json` and `build.json` for `parity` and `parity_deltas`.
  - Fix the source pack with mismatched key(s), re-run locally (`make smoke`), then push.

## Golden Snapshot

- Purpose: lock deterministic output for a canonical v3 intake and fail CI on drift.
- Fixture: `fixtures/intake_v3_golden.json` (minimal-but-complete v3).
- Snapshot: `fixtures/expected_pack_golden/01..20_*.json` generated from the fixture.
- Test: `tests/integ_py/test_golden_snapshot.py` builds from the fixture, asserts:
  - 20 canonical files exist
  - integrity errors == 0; parity ALL_TRUE (02/11/03/17 vs 14)
  - byte-for-byte equality vs snapshot (normalized to `\n` line endings)
- CI: runs the golden snapshot test (blocking) and uploads `_artifacts/golden-diff/**` on mismatch.


## Overlays (optional)

You can auto-apply overlays immediately after a successful `/build`:

- Feature flag: set `NEO_APPLY_OVERLAYS=true` to enable.
- Config: `overlays/config.yaml`
  - `apply`: list of overlays to run (order matters)
    - `19_SME_Domain` â€” ensures pack 19 refs align to sector/region/regulators
    - `20_Enterprise` â€” ensures brand/legal/stakeholders presence
    - `persistence_adaptiveness` â€” applies operations from `overlays/apply.persistence_adaptiveness.yaml`

Safety and integrity:
- The applier performs additive, minimal diffs; required keys are not overwritten.
- After apply, integrity and KPI parity (02/03/11/14/17) are recomputed. If any check fails, changes are rolled back.
- Response includes `overlays_applied: true/false` and an `overlay_summary` with `applied`, `touched_packs`, `deltas`, and post-apply `parity`.

## Build & Verify Panel

- Save Profile â†’ click Build Repo to POST `/build` and write the 20 canonical files.
- Status cards show:
  - Parity: 02â†”14 and 11â†”02 with checkmarks.
  - Integrity: file_count, errors, warnings (expandable).
  - Output path: copyable filesystem path to the generated repo.
  - Health chip: GET `/health` to display app_version, pid, and repo_output_dir.

## Reviewing Builds in the UI

- Last-Build banner: on load the UI fetches `/last-build` and displays the most recent build with timestamp, output path, aggregate parity badge, and whether overlays were applied.
- Download ZIP: after a build completes or from the Last-Build banner, click â€œDownload ZIPâ€ or fetch via `GET /download/zip` to retrieve the zipped 20-pack.
- Parity-deltas tooltips: when any parity check is false, an info icon appears next to the parity card. Activate it (click or keyboard) to see the exact key deltas, e.g. `03 PRI_min â€” 0.940 â†’ 0.950`.

### Overlay summary

When overlays are applied during a build (feature flag `NEO_APPLY_OVERLAYS=true`), the server persists an extended `_last_build.json` that includes `overlay_summary`:

- `applied`: boolean, whether overlays ran and were retained (not rolled back).
- `items[]`: Name, Version, Status, Allowlisted, Notes for each applied overlay action.
- `rollback`: `{ supported: true, last_action: 'none'|'rollback', ts: 'ISO8601' }`.

In the UI, a â€œView overlaysâ€ button appears on the Last-Build banner when `items.length > 0`. Clicking opens an accessible modal (keyboard/ESC/focus-trap) with a table of overlay items and a â€œCopy overlay JSONâ€ action. `/last-build` response headers remain strict: `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-NEO-Intake-Version: v3.0`.


### Run the intake app locally

To launch the intake form from a terminal on Windows, macOS, or Linux:

1. Install dependencies: ``pip install -e .[dev]``
2. Start the server (PowerShell or VS Code terminal): ``neo-agent serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000``
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser. The server logs the health check and profile output paths.

Alternative entry points are also available if you prefer invoking Python directly:

- ``python -m neo_agent.intake_app``
- ``python -c "from neo_agent.intake_app import create_app; create_app().serve(host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)"``

Both commands respect the ``HOST`` and ``PORT`` environment variables, allowing you to override the bind address without changing code.

A quick smoke check after startup:

- ``curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/`` should return the intake HTML.
- ``curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/profile/validate -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'`` returns JSON containing ``status`` and ``issues`` fields.

## Docker Quickstart

- Build image: ``docker build -t neo-intake:local --build-arg GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) .``
- Run: ``docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env neo-intake:local``
- Health: ``curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/health`` â†’ 200, headers include `X-NEO-Intake-Version` and `X-Commit-SHA`.

### Compose (dev)

Use ``docker-compose.dev.yml`` for local iteration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

The service listens on ``http://127.0.0.1:5000`` and emits structured JSON logs to stdout.

### Headers you'll see

- `X-Request-ID` â€” echoed from client or generated per request.
- `X-Response-Time-ms` â€” integer processing time for the request.

Error envelope example (uniform for 400/404/405/413/429/500):

```json
{"status":"error","code":"NOT_FOUND","message":"Not Found","details":{},"req_id":"..."}
```

## Legacy payloads

- Behavior matrix:
  - Legacy-only payload (top-level ``legacy`` present, no v3 concept keys ``context``/``role``/``governance_eval``) â†’ auto-migrated to v3 before validation and saved if required v3 fields are satisfied.
  - Mixed legacy+v3 for the same concept â†’ rejected with code ``DUPLICATE_LEGACY_V3_CONFLICT`` and per-field paths; telemetry is emitted with ``{"legacy_detected": true, "conflicts": <n>}``.
  - Pure v3 payload â†’ validated and saved as-is.

### Error codes

- ``DUPLICATE_LEGACY_V3_CONFLICT``: legacy fields coexist with v3 fields for the same concept.
  - Example shape:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "invalid",
      "code": "DUPLICATE_LEGACY_V3_CONFLICT",
      "conflicts": [
        {
          "code": "DUPLICATE_LEGACY_V3_CONFLICT",
          "legacy_path": "legacy.traits",
          "v3_path": "persona",
          "hint": "Remove legacy fields or provide legacy-only payload for auto-migration."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Legacy â†’ v3 mapping

- legacy.sector â†’ sector_profile.sector
- legacy.role â†’ role.role_code
- legacy.regulators[] â†’ sector_profile.regulatory[]
- legacy.traits[] / legacy.attributes[] â†’ persona.traits[]
- legacy.voice â†’ brand.voice.voice_traits[]
- legacy.tools[] / legacy.capabilities[] â†’ capabilities_tools.tool_suggestions[]
- legacy.human_gate.actions[] â†’ capabilities_tools.human_gate.actions[]
- legacy.memory.scopes[] â†’ memory.memory_scopes[]
- legacy.memory.packs[] â†’ memory.initial_memory_packs[]
- legacy.memory.sources[] â†’ memory.data_sources[]
- legacy.kpi.PRI_min â†’ governance_eval.gates.PRI_min
- legacy.kpi.HAL_max â†’ governance_eval.gates.hallucination_max
- legacy.kpi.AUD_min â†’ governance_eval.gates.audit_min

Diagnostics example (unknowns are dropped):

```json
{
  "dropped": ["legacy.unknown_field"],
  "mappings_applied": [
    "legacy.roleâ†’role.role_code",
    "legacy.kpi.PRI_minâ†’governance_eval.gates.PRI_min"
  ]
}
```
